Geocaching Events
-----------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines event kinds for geocaching on Nostr. These events allow users to create, share, and log geocaches in a decentralized manner.

## Geocache Listing Event (Kind 37515)

Geocache listing events are addressable events of kind `37515` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "kind": 37515,
  "content": "<cache description>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<cache-identifier>"],
    ["name", "<cache-name>"],
    ["g", "<geohash>"],
    ["difficulty", "<1-5>"],
    ["terrain", "<1-5>"],
    ["size", "<size>"],
    ["cache-type", "<type>"]
  ]
}
```

Listing events require all information about the cache and information relevant to finding the cache. These include the `name`, location (`g`), `difficulty` and `terrain` scores, `size`, and type of cache (`cache-type`).

These requirements are well-known and follow existing standards, such as those outlined on [geocaching.com](https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=97).

These events are assumed to be owned by the submitter of the cache, and core details should be maintained by that submitter. However, community logs should also provide context on the current state and validity of the cache.

## Content

The content field contains the cache description and any additional information about the cache.

## Tags

- `d` (required) - unique identifier for the cache
- `name` (required) - human-readable name for the cache  
- `g` (required) - geohash of cache location
- `difficulty` (required) - integer 1-5 indicating puzzle/finding difficulty
- `terrain` (required) - integer 1-5 indicating physical difficulty  
- `size` (required) - one of: `micro`, `small`, `regular`, `large`, `other`
- `cache-type` (required) - one of: `traditional`, `multi`, `mystery`
- `hint` (optional) - plaintext hint to help find the cache
- `image` (optional) - image URLs related to the cache
- `r` (optional) - preferred relay URLs for logs

## Log Event (Kind 37516)

Log events are regular events of kind `37516` that record visits to geocaches:

```json
{
  "kind": 37516,
  "content": "<log message>",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "37515:<pubkey>:<d-tag>"],
    ["log-type", "<type>"]
  ]
}
```

These events capture successes, failures, and status-related information about the cache via human reporting.

Log events use the common log types for Geocaching, namely `found` (success), `dnf` (failure), and `note` (helpful or neutral context).

Caches can be flagged as 'in maintenance' or requiring maintenance via the same 'maintenance' log. Owners of the cache can officially retire caches using an `archived` log, thus allowing the cache's history to be preserved without fully deleting it.

## Log Tags

- `a` (required) - reference to the geocache being logged
- `log-type` (required) - one of: `found`, `dnf`, `note`, `maintenance`, `archived`  
- `image` (optional) - photos from the visit

## Clients

For the best Geocaching experience, clients implementing geocaching support should:

- Hide coordinates for `mystery` cache types until the puzzle is solved.
- Support hint encoding, such as ROT13, to prevent spoilers.
- Determine cache status from recent log patterns. Multiple DNF entries and/or maintenance notes would indicate an issue with the cache.
- Publish logs to relays specified in the cache's `r` tags when available.

## Examples

### Basic Cache

```json
{
  "kind": 37515,
  "content": "The first Nostr treasure, left in the aftermath of Oslo Freedom Forum!",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "first-treasure-1748619568668"],
    ["name", "First Treasure"], 
    ["g", "u4xsu6"],
    ["difficulty", "1"],
    ["terrain", "1"],
    ["size", "small"],
    ["cache-type", "traditional"],
    ["hint", "In the branches"],
    ["image", "https://blossom.primal.net/74efe01a767b27dead71b8a9bb8278a108360438e78e55194ed9ab14a9382dd3.jpg"]
  ]
}
```

### Found Log

```json
{
  "kind": 37516,
  "content": "Found it! Great hiding spot.",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "37515:0461fcbecc4c3374439932d6b8f11269ccdb7cc973ad7a50ae362db135a474dd:first-treasure-1748619568668"],
    ["log-type", "found"]
  ]
}
```
