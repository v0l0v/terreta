Geocaching Events
-----------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines event kinds for geocaching on Nostr. These events allow users to create, share, and log geocaches in a decentralized manner.

## Geocache Listing Event (Kind 37515)

Geocache listing events are addressable events of kind `37515` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "kind": 37515,
  "content": "<cache description>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<cache-identifier>"],
    ["name", "<cache-name>"],
    ["g", "<geohash>"],
    ["difficulty", "<1-5>"],
    ["terrain", "<1-5>"],
    ["size", "<size>"],
    ["t", "<type>"]
  ]
}
```

Listing events require all information about the cache and information relevant to finding the cache. These include the `name`, location (`g`), `difficulty` and `terrain` scores, `size`, and type of cache (`t`).

Cache types are determined by individual clients, with common types including `traditional`, `multi`, and `mystery`. Clients should decide which cache types they support based on their implementation needs.

These requirements are well-known and follow existing standards, such as those outlined on [geocaching.com](https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=97).

These events are assumed to be owned by the submitter of the cache, and core details should be maintained by that submitter. However, community logs should also provide context on the current state and validity of the cache.

## Content

The content field contains the cache description and any additional information about the cache.

## Tags

- `d` (required) - unique identifier for the cache
- `name` (required) - human-readable name for the cache  
- `g` (required) - geohash of cache location
- `difficulty` (required) - integer 1-5 indicating puzzle/finding difficulty
- `terrain` (required) - integer 1-5 indicating physical difficulty  
- `size` (required) - one of: `micro`, `small`, `regular`, `large`, `other`
- `t` (required) - cache type, with common values including: `traditional`, `multi`, `mystery`
- `hint` (optional) - plaintext hint to help find the cache
- `image` (optional) - image URLs related to the cache
- `r` (optional) - preferred relay URLs for logs
- `verification` (optional) - hex-encoded public key for verifying finds at this cache

## Found Log Event (Kind 7516)

Found log events are regular events of kind `7516` that record successful visits to geocaches:

```json
{
  "kind": 7516,
  "content": "<log message>",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "37515:<pubkey>:<d-tag>"]
  ]
}
```

## Comment Log Events (Kind 1111)

Non-found logs use comment events (kind `1111`) following NIP-22 comment structure:

```json
{
  "kind": 1111,
  "content": "<log message>",
  "tags": [
    ["A", "37515:<pubkey>:<d-tag>"],
    ["K", "37515"],
    ["P", "<cache-owner-pubkey>"],
    ["a", "37515:<pubkey>:<d-tag>"],
    ["k", "37515"],
    ["p", "<cache-owner-pubkey>"],
    ["t", "<log-type>"]
  ]
}
```

These events capture failures, notes, and status-related information about the cache via human reporting, following the NIP-22 comment threading model where the geocache listing is both the root and parent content.

Comment log types include `dnf` (did not find), `note` (helpful or neutral context), and `maintenance` (cache needs attention). If no `t` tag is present, the comment is assumed to be a general note.

Owners of the cache can officially retire caches using an `archived` tag, thus allowing the cache's history to be preserved without fully deleting it.

## Tags

### Found Log Events (Kind 7516)
- `a` (required) - reference to the geocache being logged
- `image` (optional) - photos from the visit
- `verification` (optional) - embedded verification event (see Verified Finds section)

### Comment Log Events (Kind 1111)
- `A` (required) - root geocache reference (same as `a` for top-level comments)
- `K` (required) - root kind number (`37515`)
- `P` (required) - root author (cache owner pubkey)
- `a` (required) - parent reference (same as `A` for top-level comments)
- `k` (required) - parent kind number (`37515`)
- `p` (required) - parent author (cache owner pubkey)
- `t` (optional) - log type: `dnf`, `note`, `maintenance`, `archived`. If omitted, assumed to be `note`
- `image` (optional) - photos from the visit

## Verified Finds

Geocaches with verification enabled can provide cryptographic proof that a finder physically located the cache. This is accomplished through a verification event signed by the cache's verification key.

### Verification Process

When a cache has a `verification` tag containing a public key, finders can create a verified log by:

1. Obtaining the cache's verification private key (typically via QR code at the cache location)
2. Creating a verification event (kind 1985) signed by this key
3. Embedding the verification event in their log entry

### Verification Event Structure

The verification event is a kind 7517 event with the following structure:

```json
{
  "kind": 7517,
  "content": "Geocache verification for <finder-npub>",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "<finder-pubkey>:<geocache-naddr>"]
  ]
}
```

The verification event must be signed by the cache's verification private key and is typically embedded in the log event's `verification` tag, though clients may choose to publish these events to relays as well.

### Verification Validation

To validate a verified find:

1. Check that the verification event is signed by the expected verification public key
2. Verify that the finder pubkey in the `a` tag matches the log author
3. Confirm the geocache naddr in the `a` tag correctly references the target cache
4. Validate the event signature using standard Nostr verification

## Clients

For the best Geocaching experience, clients implementing geocaching support should:

- Support hint encoding, such as ROT13, to prevent spoilers.
- Determine cache status from recent log patterns. Multiple DNF entries and/or maintenance notes would indicate an issue with the cache.
- Publish logs to relays specified in the cache's `r` tags when available.
