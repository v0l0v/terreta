Geocaching Events
-----------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines event kinds for geocaching on Nostr. These events allow users to create, share, and log geocaches in a decentralized manner.

## Geocache Listing Event (Kind 37515)

Geocache listing events are addressable events of kind `37515` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "kind": 37515,
  "content": "<cache description>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<cache-identifier>"],
    ["name", "<cache-name>"],
    ["g", "<geohash>"],
    ["difficulty", "<1-5>"],
    ["terrain", "<1-5>"],
    ["size", "<size>"],
    ["cache-type", "<type>"]
  ]
}
```

Listing events require all information about the cache and information relevant to finding the cache. These include the `name`, location (`g`), `difficulty` and `terrain` scores, `size`, and type of cache (`cache-type`).

Cache types are currently limited to `traditional`, `multi`, and `mystery` as these types all use the location as either a starting point or destination.

These requirements are well-known and follow existing standards, such as those outlined on [geocaching.com](https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=97).

These events are assumed to be owned by the submitter of the cache, and core details should be maintained by that submitter. However, community logs should also provide context on the current state and validity of the cache.

## Content

The content field contains the cache description and any additional information about the cache.

## Tags

- `d` (required) - unique identifier for the cache
- `name` (required) - human-readable name for the cache  
- `g` (required) - geohash of cache location
- `difficulty` (required) - integer 1-5 indicating puzzle/finding difficulty
- `terrain` (required) - integer 1-5 indicating physical difficulty  
- `size` (required) - one of: `micro`, `small`, `regular`, `large`, `other`
- `cache-type` (required) - one of: `traditional`, `multi`, `mystery`
- `hint` (optional) - plaintext hint to help find the cache
- `image` (optional) - image URLs related to the cache
- `r` (optional) - preferred relay URLs for logs
- `verification` (optional) - hex-encoded public key for verifying finds at this cache

## Log Event (Kind 7516)

Log events are regular events of kind `7516` that record visits to geocaches:

```json
{
  "kind": 7516,
  "content": "<log message>",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "37515:<pubkey>:<d-tag>"],
    ["log-type", "<type>"]
  ]
}
```

These events capture successes, failures, and status-related information about the cache via human reporting.

Log events use the common log types for Geocaching, namely `found` (success), `dnf` (failure), and `note` (helpful or neutral context).

Caches can be flagged as 'in maintenance' or requiring maintenance via the same 'maintenance' log. Owners of the cache can officially retire caches using an `archived` log, thus allowing the cache's history to be preserved without fully deleting it.

## Tags

- `a` (required) - reference to the geocache being logged
- `log-type` (required) - one of: `found`, `dnf`, `note`, `maintenance`, `archived`  
- `image` (optional) - photos from the visit
- `verification` (optional) - embedded verification event (see Verified Finds section)

## Verified Finds

Geocaches with verification enabled can provide cryptographic proof that a finder physically located the cache. This is accomplished through a verification event signed by the cache's verification key.

### Verification Process

When a cache has a `verification` tag containing a public key, finders can create a verified log by:

1. Obtaining the cache's verification private key (typically via QR code at the cache location)
2. Creating a verification event (kind 1985) signed by this key
3. Embedding the verification event in their log entry

### Verification Event Structure

The verification event is a NIP-32 label event with the following structure:

```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "content": "Verified find by <finder-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["L", "to.treasures"],
    ["l", "found", "to.treasures"],
    ["p", "<finder-pubkey>", "", "finder"],
    ["a", "<finder-pubkey>:<geocache-naddr>", "", "geocache"]
  ]
}
```

The verification event must be signed by the cache's verification private key and embedded in the log event's `verification` tag.

### Verification Validation

To validate a verified find:

1. Check that the verification event is signed by the expected verification public key
2. Verify that the finder pubkey in both the `p` tag and `a` tag matches the log author
3. Confirm the geocache naddr in the `a` tag correctly references the target cache
4. Validate the event signature using standard Nostr verification

## Clients

For the best Geocaching experience, clients implementing geocaching support should:

- Support hint encoding, such as ROT13, to prevent spoilers.
- Determine cache status from recent log patterns. Multiple DNF entries and/or maintenance notes would indicate an issue with the cache.
- Publish logs to relays specified in the cache's `r` tags when available.
