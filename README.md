## ✨ Features

### 🏃‍♂️ Core Geocaching
- **Hide Geocaches**: Create and publish geocaches with GPS coordinates, descriptions, and difficulty ratings
- **Find Treasures**: Discover geocaches hidden by other users around the world

### 🌍 Decentralized & Open
- **Nostr Protocol**: Built on the decentralized Nostr network - no central authority
- **Censorship Resistant**: Your geocaches and logs are stored across multiple relays
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source codebase with MIT license
- **No Registration**: Login with any Nostr keypair - no email or personal data required

### 🎯 Advanced Features
- **Location Search**: Find geocaches by city, zip code, or "Near Me" functionality
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter by difficulty, terrain, cache type, and size
- **Distance Sorting**: Automatically sort results by proximity to your location
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- **Progressive Web App**: Install as a native app on mobile devices
- **Image Support**: Upload and view images for geocaches
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic syncing across the Nostr network

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/treasures.git
   cd treasures
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

Deploy to your server using our zero-downtime deployment system:

```bash
# Set your server IP
export DROPLET_IP=your.server.ip

# Smart deployment (chooses zero-downtime vs fresh automatically)
./docker/deploy.sh $DROPLET_IP

# Force fresh deployment if needed
./docker/deploy.sh $DROPLET_IP --force-fresh

# Debug deployment issues
./docker/deploy.sh $DROPLET_IP --debug
```

The deployment script automatically:
- Builds locally first to catch errors early
- Uses zero-downtime deployment when site is running
- Falls back to fresh deployment when site is down
- Tests new deployment before switching traffic
- Rolls back automatically if anything fails

See the [Docker deployment guide](./docker/README.md) for detailed instructions.

### Static Hosting

Deploy the built app to any static hosting provider:

```bash
npm run build
# Upload the dist/ folder to your hosting provider
```

The app is also configured for Surge.sh deployment:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## 🎮 How to Use

### Getting Started
1. **Open Treasures** in your web browser
2. **Connect your Nostr account** using any NIP-07 compatible browser extension (like Alby, nos2x, or Flamingo)
3. **Explore the map** to find geocaches near you or search by location

### Finding Geocaches
- Use the **search bar** to find caches by name or location
- Click **"Near Me"** to find caches around your current location  
- **Filter results** by difficulty (D1-D5) and terrain (T1-T5)
- **Adjust search radius** from 5km to 100km
- Click on **map markers** or **list items** to view cache details

### Hiding Geocaches
1. Click **"Hide a Treasure"** or the **+** icon in navigation
2. Fill out cache details: name, description, difficulty, terrain
3. **Click on the map** to set GPS coordinates
4. Add optional **hint** and **images**
5. **Publish** your cache to the Nostr network

### Logging Finds
- Open any geocache detail page
- Choose log type: **Found It**, **Didn't Find It**, or **Write Note**
- Share your experience in the log text
- **Post your log** to help other cachers

### Configuring Relays
- Go to **Settings** to manage relay preferences
- The app uses **ditto.pub** as the primary relay by default
- **Add additional relays** for redundancy if desired
- **Reorder relays** to set priority (first relay is primary)
- **Reset to defaults** to return to ditto.pub only

## 🔗 Nostr Integration

Treasures leverages the Nostr protocol for decentralized data storage:

### Event Types
- **Kind 37515**: Geocache listings (addressable events per NIP-GC)
- **Kind 37516**: Geocache log entries (per NIP-GC)
- **Kind 0**: User profile metadata
- **Kind 3**: Following relationships (for social features)

### Relays
The app uses ditto.pub as the primary Nostr relay by default:
- `wss://ditto.pub/relay` (primary relay)

Users can configure additional relays in Settings if desired. The app is designed to work with any standard Nostr relay that supports the required event types.

### Data Format
Geocaches are stored as Nostr events with custom tags for location, difficulty, terrain, and other metadata. All data is cryptographically signed and verifiable.
